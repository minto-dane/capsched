Read this first when resuming the project.

## Current State

The workspace is `/media/nia/scsiusb/dev/linux-cap`.
The project-control Git repository is `/media/nia/scsiusb/dev/linux-cap/capsched`.

Upstream Linux has been fetched into sibling repository `linux/`. No Linux
source changes have been made. No implementation patch points are accepted yet.
The source-analysis pass has been expanded through policy front-ends, mutable
kernel state, dangerous surfaces, network/socket endpoints, io_uring registered
resources, BPF programmable policy boundaries, scheduler topology/cluster
partitions, and the first formal model selection. The first Runnable Lease TLA+
model has been written and checked with TLC in a tiny finite model. A candidate
Linux L0 Runnable Lease implementation plan now exists, derived from that model
and the upstream scheduler maps.

## Recovery Path

Read in this order:

1. `capsched/capsched-ai/state/state.json`
2. `capsched/capsched-ai/handoff.md`
3. `capsched/capsched-ai/design/compact.md`
4. `capsched/capsched-ai/decisions/index.md`
5. `capsched/capsched-models/analysis/index.md`
6. Any referenced ADRs or current plans

Only read longer files when the current task requires them.

## Project Essence

CapSched-Linux is a Linux scheduler and kernel architecture project. The
long-term goal is not merely better containers. It is process-to-container-scale
Domain isolation with VM-like protection strength and datacenter OS efficiency.

The final architecture is:

```text
Domain-aware Linux kernel
+ typed capability/resource endpoints
+ per-Domain mutable kernel state
+ small HyperTag Monitor enforcing non-forgeable roots
```

The Linux-only L0 prototype is for integration, semantics, and performance. It
must not claim hypervisor-grade isolation.

## Design Memory

Use this as the mental model:

```text
Capability = scheduled authority
```

Execution activates an authority context. The scheduler should activate
`DomainTag + SchedContext + Thread` under a frozen execution lease.

Implementation must keep capability types separated:

- `RunCap`: enqueue/runnable submission only
- `SchedContext`: CPU time/budget/period/placement/co-tenancy
- `FrozenRunUse`: enqueue-time frozen execution lease
- `DomainTag`: active protection context
- `SpawnCap`: bounded creation authority
- `ThreadControlCap`: suspend/resume/terminate/inspect
- `SchedControlCap`: scheduling parameter changes
- `EndpointCap`, `QueueCap`, `MemoryCap`: resource-specific endpoint authority
- `BudgetTicket`: donated caller budget for broker/service execution

## Do Not Do Yet

- Do not choose exact Linux patch points before reading current upstream code.
- Do not implement before writing investigation notes and a semantic model.
- Do not merge Linux source and project state into one repository.
- Do not claim security properties for Linux-only prototypes.
- Do not treat BPF, sched_ext, cpuset, or sched domains as the production
  security root. They are compatibility and policy substrates.

## Next Likely Action

The first formal semantic model has been selected and checked. Runnable lease
semantics are modeled in:

```text
capsched/capsched-models/formal/0002-runnable-lease-model/
```

TLC result:

```text
capsched/capsched-models/validation/0001-runnable-lease-tlc.md
```

Do not implement Linux patches yet. The next gate is reviewing the candidate
Linux L0 implementation plan and explicitly choosing the first
no-behavior-change patch slice.

Candidate implementation plan:

```text
capsched/capsched-models/implementation/0001-l0-runnable-lease-implementation-plan.md
```

Additional source-analysis anchors:

```text
capsched/capsched-models/analysis/0013-bpf-programmable-policy-boundary.md
capsched/capsched-models/analysis/0014-scheduler-topology-cluster-partition-map.md
```

Current Linux source state:

```text
repo: ../linux
remote: upstream = https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
branch: capsched-linux-l0
base: upstream/master
commit: 4edcdefd4083ae04b1a5656f4be6cd83ae919ef4
