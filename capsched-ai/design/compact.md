# Compact Context

Updated: 2026-06-25

## Project

CapSched-Linux aims to introduce a capability-oriented execution and resource
authority model into Linux scheduler foundations. The long-term target is a
datacenter OS substrate where process-, service-, container-, tenant-, and
cluster-cell-scale domains can receive isolation strength comparable to VM
boundaries at lower operational cost.

Upstream Linux source has been fetched into sibling repository `linux/`.
The current work branch is `capsched-linux-l0` at commit
`4edcdefd4083ae04b1a5656f4be6cd83ae919ef4`. No implementation patch points are
decided yet. A first deep source-analysis pass now exists in
`capsched-models/analysis/0002` through `0007`.

## Core Architecture

CapSched-Linux has two tracks:

- Linux-only CapSched L0: prototype for performance, integration, and semantic
  exploration. It must not claim hypervisor-grade isolation.
- Monitor-backed CapSched-H: production architecture with a small HyperTag
  Monitor below Linux. The monitor enforces DomainTag, epochs, MemoryViews,
  IOMMU/queue ownership, and root CPU budgets that Linux must not forge.

The high-level idea is:

```text
shared Linux ABI and mostly shared kernel text
+ per-Domain mutable kernel state
+ RunCap / SchedContext scheduler authority
+ typed resource endpoints
+ service/driver Domains
+ HyperTag Monitor-enforced MemoryViews and IOMMU
```

## Capability View

Top-level research idea:

```text
Capability = scheduled authority
```

Execution itself activates authority. The scheduler should not decide every VFS,
socket, GPU, or BPF semantic operation. Instead, it selects the active authority
context. Resource endpoints check resource-specific capabilities.

Implementation must keep types separated:

- `RunCap`: authority to submit a specific thread/task to become runnable.
- `SchedContext`: CPU time, period, remaining budget, allowed CPUs, priority,
  and co-tenancy constraints.
- `FrozenRunUse`: enqueue-time frozen execution lease; runqueues must not store
  raw capability handles as authority.
- `DomainTag`: active protection context selected at context switch.
- `ThreadControlCap`: suspend/resume/terminate/inspect.
- `SchedControlCap`: change budget, period, priority, affinity, co-tenancy.
- `SpawnCap`: create thread/process/domain with attenuated initial authority.
- `EndpointCap`/`QueueCap`/`MemoryCap`: resource endpoint authorities.
- `BudgetTicket`: bounded caller budget donated to broker/service execution.

## Accepted Invariants

```text
No RunCap, no enqueue.
No SchedContext, no execution.
No budget, no execution.
No FrozenRunUse, no runqueue entry.
No valid epoch/generation, no execution.
No DomainTag activation, no cross-Domain context switch.
No async work without provenance and frozen authority.
No caller budget, no broker/service execution on behalf of that caller.
No raw pointer or mutable kernel object authority across Domain boundaries.
Linux-only prototypes must not claim hypervisor-grade isolation.
```

## Threat Model

The eventual threat model is intentionally hostile. An attacker may control all
user space inside a Domain and may exploit reachable Linux kernel bugs. The
production goal is that even arbitrary code execution in that Domain's Linux
kernel context cannot reach:

- other Domain user memory
- other Domain mutable kernel state
- HyperTag Monitor memory/state
- global scheduling authority
- other Domain device queues or DMA memory
- root management Domain

This requires monitor-backed roots and per-Domain mutable kernel state. A single
shared mutable Linux kernel address space cannot support this claim.

## Datacenter and Cluster Direction

Domain should not mean only process or only container. It should be a schedulable
protection/resource/audit context that can represent:

```text
ClusterCell -> Tenant -> Service -> ContainerDomain -> ProcessDomain -> Thread
```

Cluster direction: do not make one monolithic distributed kernel. Prefer a
single capability/resource lease namespace where signed cluster leases compile
into local node SchedContexts and endpoint capabilities.

## Near-Term Sequence

1. Use `capsched-models/plans/0001-upstream-analysis-plan.md` and `0002` as
   the analysis record.
2. Read `capsched-models/analysis/0002` through `0007` before proposing patch
   points.
3. Draft the formal model-selection memo.
4. Model runnable lease semantics first unless a stronger argument emerges.
5. Validate semantics with TLA+ or similar before prototype implementation.
